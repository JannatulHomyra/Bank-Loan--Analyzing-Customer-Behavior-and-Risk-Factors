#Bank Loan: Analyzing Customer Behavior and Risk Factors
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and identifying risk factors associated with loan defaults. The objective is to help banks make informed decisions by pinpointing the types of loans that are most likely to default and identifying the attributes of customers who are at a higher risk of defaulting on their loans.

#Project Overview
In this capstone project, I utilized various data analysis techniques to examine historical loan data. By investigating the patterns and characteristics of both successful and defaulted loans, I aimed to provide actionable insights that can guide banks in refining their loan approval processes.

#Key Objectives
Identify High-Risk Loans: Determine which types of loans have the highest default rates and suggest measures for mitigating these risks.
Analyze Customer Attributes: Examine customer data to identify key attributes that contribute to loan defaults.
Recommend Actions: Propose strategies for banks to take preventive measures against potential defaults, thereby increasing the success rate of issued loans.

#Methodology
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensured the data was clean, consistent, and ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to uncover Loan Characteristics and Default Pattern in the dataset which had appx 900k entries.
Created effective questions to make more sense of the data and get to the point where all the questions could be answered properly in numbers and visuals.
Used Excel to clean the data. Tableau for visualizing and identifying the patterns and trends with correlation matrices. Ran Univariated and Bivariated Analysis to achieve the goals respectively.

#Findings
Identified specific loan types with high default rates. (1) Small Business Loans having 28% Default rate but very high revenue. (2) Renewable Energy Loand having high success rate but less applicants and less revenue.
Highlighted key customer attributes (alongside credit score, DTIs, Revolving Utilization %) that are strong indicators of default risk such as Ratio of Installment with Monthly Income, Average Interest Rate, Housing Condition.


Provided actionable recommendations for banks to improve their loan approval process upon checking on the background and reduce the incidence of loan defaults, because more success in the Small Business Loans can bring up greater revenue for the bank.
Also do campaigns for "Renewable Energy" and to show people how futuristic the investment is. That can target customers from all kinds and build more revenue from that.
